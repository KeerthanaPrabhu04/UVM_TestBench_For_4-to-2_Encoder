Verifying the functionality of a 4-to-2 encoder using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) on EDA Playground allows for a structured and automated testing environment. UVM provides components like the environment, driver, monitor, and scoreboard to comprehensively test the encoder's behavior under various input scenarios. EDA Playground acts as a convenient online platform for simulating the encoder design and executing the UVM testbench. This combination ensures the encoder operates as expected by applying diverse input patterns and comparing the outputs against the correct encoded values.
